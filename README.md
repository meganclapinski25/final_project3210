# Battleship 🎯

A simple real-time Battleship game built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**.

Players can join from two browser tabs, automatically get matched, and take turns firing at each other’s grid. The game tracks hits, misses, turns, and points — and shows a win/loss message when all ships are sunk.
